## Biological Simulation with Arrows in Mathematica


Cellerator is a collection of tools that aide biological 
modeling via the automated conversion of chemical reactions 
to differential equations and their subsequent solution via 
numerical integration or stochastic simulation.

For a basic installation of all required mathematical files and plugins, 
download the latest Cellerator install file. 

For the python version, see the pycellerator project at https://github.com/biomathman/pycellerator
