# Cellerator: Biological Simulation with Arrows in Mathematica
## Overview
Cellerator is a collection of tools that aide biological modeling via the automated conversion of chemical reactions to differential equations and their subsequent solution via numerical integration or stochastic simulation. Please keep in mind, this repo is an attempt to maintain Cellerator, and some of the instructions made be out of date/there may be an occasional compatibility issue with new versions of mathematica. 

## Instalation 
For a basic installation of Cellerator, please download the [lastest realease](https://github.com/emedwede/cellerator/releases/tag/v1), xCellerator-Basic-Build. Once downloaded, unzip to your desired directory, and then open up `basic-installer.nb` in mathematica and run `evaluate notebook`. This should write the log file in the same directory, which tells you where in the mathematica folder the files were installed. You should be able to open up and run most examples in the example folder. More details on examples can be found [here](https://ics.uci.edu/~emedwede/examples/index.html). You can alternatively refer to this [quickstart guide](https://ics.uci.edu/~emedwede/usersguide/Quick-Start.html) or [basic install guide](https://ics.uci.edu/~emedwede/usersguide/basicinstall.html) if you run into any trouble. The key to any installation of a matethematica package is making sure the files are put into the right folders.
